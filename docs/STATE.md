# Vamphalf state inventory

What a savestate or a state dump has to carry, kept current as RTL lands (the skill's
`savestates.md`). "Skip" needs a reason: a ROM table from the `.mra`, or something re-derived
every frame.

## RAMs

| Region | RTL | Width x depth | Bytes | Save? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | |

## Registers and FSMs

| What | RTL | Bits | Save? | MAME `save_item` equivalent |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | |

## Chip state

| Chip | Module | Addressable? | Tier | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | |

## Deliberately skipped

| What | Why it need not be saved |
|---|---|
| | |

## Frame alignment

Restore point (normally `frame_start`), and anything whose phase must be saved with it: sprite or
tile double-buffer selection, snapshot ownership bits.
